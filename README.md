# Overview

This programming assignment will exercise your skills with Java generics
and refactoring an existing code base.

The topics that you will cover in this assignment are:

  1. Java generics
  2. Maintaining code / refactoring
  
If you don't complete the assignment or your implementation has bugs, you
still need to turn in  your partial / broken implementation to receive
feedback. However, you should make sure that your work compiles. 

Tip: Commit and push to your repository frequently so that the instructor
can see your incremental work. Particularly for people that struggle 
with the assignment, lots of commits will show the effort that you put
in and raise your score. Also, 
   
What to do:
   1. See the ProximityDB interface for instructions
   2. You will likely build off of your GeoDB and GeoHash implementations. 
   3. When your implementation is complete, make sure the most up
      to date version is committed and pushed to your assignment
      repository.
      
Warning! There may be typos, bugs, or other issues with the assignment.
If you encounter a bug, typo, etc., please post to the course discussion
forum to let the instructor know.
